# The Sketch
[[The Sketch]] is a modelling diagram for which the simplified equations of motion of a re-entry vehicle can be derived. Drawing it correctly is asked on __every__ exam.

Here it is:

In the slides, it appears in lecture 5 on slide 48, and several times afterwards as the starting point of the trajectory derivations. 

From this important diagram, the simplified equations of motions are derived, which you can see together in the figure below:
