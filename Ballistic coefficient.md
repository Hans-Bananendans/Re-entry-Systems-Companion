# Ballistic coeffient

The ballistic coefficient that is used in the literature of this course is the **weight-referenced** ballistic coefficient, defined as:
$$K = \dfrac{mg}{C_DS}$$
For this reason, its units are in [$N/m^2$]. We will use this as the default "ballistic coeffient" as much as possible.

This is in contrast with the mass-referenced ballistic coefficient, which is defined as 
$$k \equiv K_m = \dfrac{m}{C_DS}$$
And therefore has units in [$kg/m^2$]. We will not use this in any of the derivation and theory here, but it may sometimes come up in examples. As such, we will use the small $k$ (or $K_m$ like the reader) for this ballistic coeffiecent.

In some literature, there is an reciprocal mass-referenced ballistic coefficent, which is called the ballistic coefficient, but defined as $1/k$. We will not use this definition **at all** in order to avoid confusion, but do note that it exists out there in the wild.
