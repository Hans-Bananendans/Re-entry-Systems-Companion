# Exam Content Guide
This page is a place where all information relevant to the Re-entry Systems exam will be compiled.


## Ground rules for exam:
 - No __graphic calculators__ allowed on the exam
 - State __assumptions__ and used input
 - Do not forget to include __units__ in answers
 - When integrating, write down integral and boundaries. Just writing "integrate" is __not__ sufficient.
 - 

## General exam layout
1. [[Question about atmospheric entry]]. Can either be ballistic entry, gliding entry, or skipping entry.
	1. Draw [[The Sketch]].
	2. __State__ the general equations of motion for re-entry flight (no derivation needed)
	$$m \dfrac{dV}{dt} = -D -mg \sin(\gamma)$$
	$$mV \dfrac{d\gamma}{dt} = L-mg \cos \left(1-\dfrac{V^2}{gR} \right)$$
	$$\dfrac{dR}{dt} = \dfrac{dh}{dt} = V\sin(\gamma)$$
	3. Derive the maximum deceleration $\bar{a}_{max}$ and show assumptions.
	4. Derive $\bar{a}_{max}$ for a purely ballistic path instead.
	5. Reason how vehicle characteristics affect maximum deceleration.
	6. Reason how initial position and velocity impact maximum deceleration
	7. Fill in the numbers for a real-life example.
	8. Same but with an off-nominal case with a different entry angle.
	9. In case of control system failure, what can astronauts do? (nothing)
2. [[True-False questions]]
3. [[Question about parachute design]]
	1. State main requirements for using parachutes on a mission
	2. Explain function of pilot chute, drogue chute, and main chute.
	3. Explain what parachute reefing is.
	4. Explain why parachute clusters are used.
	5. Derive equation for impact velocity while starting at vertical parachute equilibrium. It helps here to make a free body diagram of the situation.
	6. Fill in the numbers -> what are the required parachute diameters for given impact speed
4. [[Question on Guidance and Navigation]]
